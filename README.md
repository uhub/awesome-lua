* [xs-embedded-llc/l2dbus](https://github.com/xs-embedded-llc/l2dbus) - Lua-to-D-Bus (L2DBUS) is a Lua module that provides a *nearly* complete binding to the D-Bus IPC service. It is not, however, a complete re-implementation of the D-Bus protocol in Lua but instead leverages the tested D-Bus reference library which implements the lower-level protocol stack. What L2DBUS does provide, however, is access to lower-level features of D-Bus along with a higher level abstraction to make developing Lua D-Bus clients and services easier. These capabilities make it entirely feasible to re-implement a low level program like *dbus-monitor* in Lua as well more complex client/server applications. In this respect the Lua binding is similar to the popular D-Bus Python binding without the implicit GLib/GObject dependency. Hopefully L2DBUS strikes a balance between both low and high level APIs so that there really isn't any D-Bus related feature that is not available to the developer.
